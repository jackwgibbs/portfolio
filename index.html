                <p class="rightpane">
                    As a passionate Java Developer and recent graduate, I am committed to creating high-quality software solutions to solve complex problems.
                    My experience working within a collaborative team has provided me with first-hand experience in the scrum methodology,
                    and I have developed a solid foundation in Agile development and collaborative teamwork.
                    <br><br>
                    In my role at Equiniti, I heavily focus on Java development and have a strong proficiency in designing RESTful
                    APIs using frameworks such as Spring. I also have extensive experience in automated testing using Cucumber,
                    ensuring that the software I deliver meets the highest quality standards.
                    <br><br>
                    With a high First-Class degree and Deans Commendation from The University of Exeter,
                    I have a strong academic background in Computer Science. My research focused on the emerging field of
                    lightweight cryptography, particularly lightweight encryption primitives for resource-constrained devices.
                    I have successfully designed, implemented, and tested a command line tool that implements a selection of such primitives.
                    <br><br>
                    I am an avid learner and enjoy engaging in individual projects outside of work,
                    including developing a web-based Spotify stats dashboard and a group planner application for friends.
                    I am highly motivated, determined, and driven to continuously enhance my skills and knowledge in software development.
